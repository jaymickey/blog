A few weeks ago (May 19th - 23rd) was KubeCon & CloudNativeCon. Held in Barcelona this year the conference welcomed over 7000 attendees through its doors, making it one of the largest tech conferences in the world. 

Thanks to my amazing employer - Cond√© Nast International - I was lucky enough to attend the conference for the first time.
