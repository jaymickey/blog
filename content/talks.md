Occasionally I give talks at meetups or conferences. A full history of my talks in the form of slides can be found on [SpeakerDeck](https://mickey.dev/speakerdeck). Below is a list of the most recent talks I've given, along with any video recordings.

## Finding a Needle in a Call Stack - Intro to Distributed Tracing
**Presented:** [DDD Perth](https://dddperth.com/) (August 2019), [Cloud Native London Conf](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/11723-cloudnative-london-2019) (Sept 2019)

**[Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jmickey/finding-a-needle-in-a-call-stack-intro-to-distributed-tracing)**

In this session I explore the basics of distributed tracing. I then take a look at the OpenTelemetry (formally OpenTracing) standard - a vendor neutral framework for distributed tracing instrumentation. Finally, I take a hands-on look at distributed tracing in action using Jaeger, a popular open source distributed tracing tool which is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. By the end of this session I hope viewers will not only have a good understanding of distributed tracing, but will be equipped with the knowledge and inspiration to introduce it within their own applications.

## Killing Bugs with KINDness - Kubernetes in CI with K8s in Docker (KIND)

**Presented:** [Docker London](https://docker.london) (July 2019)

**[Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jmickey/kubernetes-in-docker-killing-bugs-with-kindness)**

KIND - Kubernetes IN Docker - is a relatively new tool for running Kubernetes clusters within Docker. KIND enables engineers to spin up local development cluster in under a minute, utilising Docker containers as "nodes". KIND was originally born as a method of running conformance tests for the Kubernetes project itself, and has quickly gained in popularity within the community thanks to its fast startup time, ease of use, and growing feature set. In this talk I will briefly look at how KIND differs from other local cluster tools, discuss a range of possible use-cases for KIND - both for local development and within CI/CD pipelines, and finally demonstrate how you can get starting using KIND.
