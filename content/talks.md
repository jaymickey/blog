# Talks

Occasionally I give talks at meetups or conferences. A full history of my talks in the form of slides can be found on [SpeakerDeck](https://mickey.dev/speakerdeck). Below is a list of the most recent talks I've given, along with any video recordings.

## Finding a Needle in a Call Stack - Intro to Distributed Tracing
**Presented:** DDD Perth - August 2019

**[Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jmickey/finding-a-needle-in-a-call-stack-intro-to-distributed-tracing)**

In this session I explore the basics of distributed tracing. I then take a look at the OpenTelemetry (formally OpenTracing) standard - a vendor neutral framework for distributed tracing instrumentation. Finally, I take a hands-on look at distributed tracing in action using Jaeger, a popular open source distributed tracing tool which is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. By the end of this session I hope viewers will not only have a good understanding of distributed tracing, but will be equipped with the knowledge and inspiration to introduce it within their own applications.
